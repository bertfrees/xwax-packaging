---------------

This package differs from the upstream release in the following ways:

*  The xwax_import and xwax_scan scripts are located in /usr/share/xwax to conform with the Debian filesystem hierarchy.

Please consult the xwax homepage (www.xwax.co.uk) for further information on suggested hardware configuration.
